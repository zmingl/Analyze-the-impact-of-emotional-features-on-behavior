Now today's episode is brought to you by buyaboat.com. Need a boat? Then go to buyaboat.com. Boats.com is better than buyaboat.com. Now Dylan said the word bomb squad. What does bomb squad mean exactly? Well I'm about to explain it to you. Basically, in our household, sometimes we say stuff a little ironically or sarcastically and we can't tell if the other person is serious. We'll be like, ""Are you serious, you really do like Green Day? Or are you goofing me?"". That's what we'll be like, we'll be like, ""Are you goofing me, or what?"" So we developed a safe word in our house that we can never break. So if we say the word bomb squad, it means that we are being 100% honest, no lie, no joke, no irony. So I could be like, ""I don't like chicken, bomb squad, I swear, I don't like chicken."" That means 100% I don't like chicken and I'm not just goofing and gagging you around. So Dylan used the word bomb squad in the middle of our One Night Werewolf game which beforehand we banned because this whole game is about telling who's lying and who's telling the truth. So if you bring out our safe word, it kind of destroys the game because you could be like, ""Are you the Werewolf, tell me, bomb squad."" And you would have to be like, ""Oh, bomb squad, I am the Werewolf."" It's a thing that can't be broken in our household so it cannot be used in the game.
